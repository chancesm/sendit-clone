# sendit-clone
Clone of Sendit.sh by @anthdm. Stream files from ssh to http with no file storage on the server. I'll probably keep hacking on this periodically.

# TODO:
- [x] Setup base repo with dev container and github codespace
- [x] Setup Base Project following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK5xh7xH1Jw&t=26s
- [ ] Split into multiple files/packages
- [ ] Add Web Framework (Echo, Fiber, ?)
- [ ] Add Web View with file download (keep current functionality behind a `raw` query param or route param)
